## About Me

I came across the **al-folio** open-source repo, and thanks to it I was able to fork and set up this GitHub page.  
My goal here is simple: **learn new things, document the process, and share along the way.**

I’m not a “true” statistician, data scientist, data engineer, or software engineer—just a curious generalist who enjoys picking up bits of everything. A jack of all trades, master of none. That said, I have ambitious goals: to keep growing, explore new ideas, and hopefully one day build something meaningful from the knowledge I’ve gathered.
