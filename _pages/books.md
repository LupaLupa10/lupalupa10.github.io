> Over the years, I’ve bought so many books. Some are just collecting dust, while others I only managed to read a few pages of. It’s like getting a new toy or game—I always feel excited when I get a new book, but I usually only end up touching it and reading just a little. Having something like this could be a great way to keep track of my progress and motivate myself to read more.
